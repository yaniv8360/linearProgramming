This Python script uses the PuLP library to define and solve a Linear Programming (LP) problem.
The goal is to find the minimum vertex cover for a given graph.
The script is specifically designed to compare the results of a linear programming algorithm with those of a naive algorithm for finding the minimum vertex cover in different graphs.
If there is a difference between the LP objective value and the naive algorithm result, it prints a message indicating the difference.
